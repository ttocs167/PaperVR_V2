# PaperVR_V2

This is one of my first unity projects, a VR experience made when the vive was first released.
I worked on this with 3 friends as a side project during my 2nd year of university.
The aim was to make a rogue like VR game similar to how the Binding of Isaac plays, with procedurally generated floors and random enemies.
You would earn random powerups by progressing and the game would get harder as you go.
We didn't get far with these goals but I learned a lot about developing in for unity and in C#.
